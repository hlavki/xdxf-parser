# xdxf-parser

Event based API to parse xdxf dictionary files. This API doesn't read all dictionary content to memory, but fire events on every XDXF entity (article, dictionary, etc.). API uses SJSXP pull parser to parse xdxf file. 

XDXF (XML Dictionary eXchange Format) is a project to unite all existing open dictionaries and provide both users and developers with universal XML-based format. This implementation does not support all xdxf features and is in alpha version quality!
